# Virtual Reality Assignment
My assignment for my virtual reality module at University. This VR application presents a small city landscape that allows the player to walk around. The scene has a traffic light system that causes cars to stop as well as pedestrian crossings where cars also stop. There are some bricks in the environment that the player can pick up and throw. Cars and pedestrians will also stop infront of the player.
